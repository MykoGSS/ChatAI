# Issue with file_picker Package on Linux

## Problem Description
When running a Flutter application on Linux, the following error occurs:
```
Package file_picker:linux references file_picker:linux as the default plugin, but it does not provide an inline implementation.
Ask the maintainers of file_picker to either avoid referencing a default implementation via `platforms: linux: default_package: file_picker` or add an inline implementation to file_picker via `platforms: linux:` `pluginClass` or `dartPluginClass`.
```

## Analysis
This error suggests that the file_picker package is incorrectly configured for Linux platform support. The package declares itself as the default plugin for Linux but doesn't provide an actual implementation.

## Solution Approach
1. Check current pubspec.yaml configuration
2. Investigate if there's a newer version available
3. Consider alternative approaches for Linux file picking functionality
4. If needed, create a custom solution or workaround

## Next Steps
- [ ] Analyze current pubspec.yaml file
- [ ] Check available versions of file_picker
- [ ] Research alternative solutions for Linux file picking
- [ ] Implement appropriate fix or workaround
